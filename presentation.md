# Subquery

## Definition:  
Subqueries (also known as inner queries or nested queries) are a tool for performing operations in multiple steps. 

## Important rules:

- Subqueries can be used with SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE statements along with expression operator.
- You can place the Subquery in a number of SQL clauses: WHERE clause, HAVING clause, FROM clause.
- The subquery generally executes <b>first</b> when the subquery doesnâ€™t have any co-relation with the main query, when there is a co-relation the parser takes the decision on the fly on which query to execute on precedence and uses the output of the subquery accordingly.
